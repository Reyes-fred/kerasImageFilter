# kerasImageFilter
This project want to create a art image base on two previous images, one would be the based image meanwhile the second will help us to be the filter that we are going to combine with the first one.

This project was inspired by a paper where the use neural algorithm to make artistic style.

In this project we are going to make an approach base on this study using two frameworks: Keras and TensorFlow.
